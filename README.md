## User Story

Your artist is excited about the work you've done thus far on the app, but they are requesting a few improvements:

- As a user, they would like to be able to update a song.
- As a user, they would like to use an API to get a list of their top 100 songs.
- As a user, they would like to be able to search through this list of songs
- As a user, they would like some moderate styling done to the app.

## Student Instructions

You have already completed the Read, Create, and Delete functionality for the app. Good news is you've gotten a good portion of the work done for your client, but there is room for some improvement. Some of the topics we will cover during today's lesson are:

- Update functionality in a CRUD application
- Web APIs
- JavaScript ASYNC/AWAIT
- Bootstrap Styling Library
- Responsive Design

You will only need your previous Codesandbox Verzuz project to get started.
